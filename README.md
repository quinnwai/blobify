# blobify

## Description
Using k means to determine my most similar groups of liked songs by cluster (affectionately called blobs). Planning on expanding this to allow for visualization of the clusters and also suggest similar songs I haven't liked yet within the clusters. the ````test-scripts```` folder contains my data science proof of concept, where so far I am still trying to determine the best way to visualize and group songs for recommendation purposes.
